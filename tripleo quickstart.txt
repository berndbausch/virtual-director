Usual 3O workflow from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziosLhUoh9s
- Install undercloud (not that difficult)
- run validation scripts
- Ironic: 
  node introspection, collecting many facts, optionally performance data.
- Deployment information --> config files
  In particular network info
- Deploy controller
  Deploy computes
  Machine determined by flavor-matching or tagging
  os-net-config
  configuration done by Puppet modules on nodes
  7 puppet steps - DB, Message, ...., Pacemaker
- Scale up (more computes and other nodes)
- Set up HA


Needed:
- quickstart host. No need for power. Recommend VM. Ansible and other software
  will be installed there. Install Centos.
  Needs a root and a non-root account, here named "stack".
- VIRTHOST. Should have 32GB memory; 16GB is a bit tight. Install minimal
  Centos. 
  This host runs at least three VMs: Undercloud, Overcloud Controller and
  Overcloud Compute.
  Needs a root and a non-root account, here named "stack".

Quickstart config options: .quickstart/tripleo-quickstart/config
Older images - try http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/rdo/images
To build images: http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/tripleo-quickstart-extras/tree/roles/build-images/README.md


On the quickstart host:

- Copy public SSH keys of root and stack to VIRTHOST root and stack. 
- Get the quickstart script curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/tripleo-quickstart/master/quickstart.sh
- Install required software
  $ bash quickstart.sh --install-deps
- Provision the VIRTHOST and start the Undercloud
  Optionally, add -R <releasename> for older releases.
  $ bash quickstart.sh -e docker_registry_namespace_used=tripleomaster -e container_build_id=current-tripleo jupiter
- In case of errors, use the log _quickstart.log
- Enter the Undercloud:
  $ ssh -F /home/stack/.quickstart/ssh.config.ansible undercloud

Most of the time is spent download images. This is done in
/home/stack/.quickstart/tripleo-quickstart/roles/fetch-images/tasks/fetch.yml.
Alternative: Copy images to a local web server, then set
	undercloud_image_url
	overcloud_image_url
	ipa_image_url

On the Undercloud:

Further instructions start at 
http://tripleo.org/basic_deployment/basic_deployment_cli.html#upload-images
- $ source stackrc
- Add overcloud images to Glance
  $ openstack overcloud image upload
- review the instackenv.json file. It describes a controller and a compute.
- register nodes
  $ openstack overcloud node import instackenv.json
  after which the nodes are in the manageable state. 
- Introspection
