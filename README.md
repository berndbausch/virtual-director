Red Hat Director setup on virtual machines

This repo was originally written for Liberty-based RHOSP 8. The little information I gathered on setting up Liberty Tripleo in a virtual environment is now in its own branch, named RHOSP8. The master contains instructions and thoughts for Newton-based Tripleo, equivalent to Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.
Feel free to add a Gist with thoughts and problems.
