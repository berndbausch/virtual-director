Tripleo setup on virtual machines

This repo was originally written for Liberty-based RHOSP 8. The little information I gathered on setting up Liberty Tripleo in a virtual environment is now in its own branch, named RHOSP8. The master contains instructions and thoughts for Newton-based Tripleo, equivalent to Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.

Newton-based Tripleo will be officially supported until August 2018. After that, it will disappear from tripleo.org, but it can still be installed with a little additional effort.

Feel free to add an Issue with thoughts and problems.
